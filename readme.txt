This plugin allows you to use your website as a voting advice application.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to use your website as a [voting advice application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_advice_application).

It was once developed for the “[Kommunal-O-Mat](http://kommunalomat-ka.de)” for the local elections 2014 Karlsruhe for the [Stadtjugendausschuss Karlsruhe (stja)](https://stja.de).

Such as:
* [Wahl-O-Mat (Germany)](https://www.wahl-o-mat.de/)
* [Who Shall I Vote For? (UK)](http://www.whoshallivotefor.com/)
* [Vote Match (EU)](https://www.votematch.eu/)

So far, WP Open Votomat can only be used as a standalone version. For the future, a shortcode and widget integration is planned.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Use the Settings->Plugin Name screen to configure the plugin
